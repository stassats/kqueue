Only file-system events (EVFILT_VNODE) are supported.

(with-kqueue (foo `(("/tmp/test" ,(logior note-write note-attrib))))
  (read-events foo))
blocks

$ echo x >> /tmp/test

 =>

(#<EVENT #P"/tmp/test" flags: NOTE-WRITE>)

The flags are only printed using names, the actual values are integers.

An easy way to check for multiple events:
(member (logior note-write note-read)
        events
        :key #'event-flag
        :test #'logtest)
